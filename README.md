# ICEcons

This is a fork of the ICEcons icon pack for trebuchet, kiss, nova, apex, holo, asus, adw and many more launchers. There are over 200 icons and a few wallpapers included as well. This is my first project with Inkscape but I will add icons when I have the time, submitting icon requests helps a lot.

## Icon Requests

I am working on some scripts that will scrape the issues page for icon requests so please use the following format. Label the issue **Icon Request** and use the app [Turtl](https://f-droid.org/app/org.xphnx.iconsubmit) to create a zip file with the apps you would like to be added or modified.

## Contributing

If you know how to create vectors and have some spare time feel free to help me convert all of the icons to svg or just make some new ones, I would love the help. You don't even have to know how to code, just throw them in the svg directory and I will take care of the rest. If you'd like to help me work on the app itself that would also be great, I would eventually like to port [moonshine](https://github.com/natewren/moonshine-iconpack) if I ever have the time using the code from this app.
